This is the readme.txt for prob1 of proj2.
The program can execute ==, !=, >, <, +, -, * operator.
I implemented it so that the two operators can use each other.
For example operator + use operator -, and operator - use operator +, and operator * use operator + in some cases.

HOW TO EXECUTE
Open prob1.sln file.
Then the VisualStudio will be executed.
You can execute the program by clicking "local windows debugger" or press the "F5" key.
